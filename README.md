# kicky
Kick drum keyfinder.

This tool takes a folder containing kick drum samples, finds the key of the samples, and creates a new folder containing the original files renamed to include their key.

I chose to copy + rename since renaming might break existing DAW project files. Not to mention, kick samples are relatively lightweight.

Noted constraints:
- batch process only
- wav files only
